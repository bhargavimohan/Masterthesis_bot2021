	abstract = {Modelling is a fundamental activity in software engineering, which is often performed in collaboration. For this purpose, on-line tools running on the cloud are frequently used. However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing have fostered the emergence of chatbots, which are increasingly used for all sorts of software engineering tasks, including modelling. To evaluate to what extent chatbots are suitable for collaborative modelling, we conducted an experimental study with 54 participants, to evaluate the usability of a modelling chatbot called {SOCIO}, comparing it with the on-line tool Creately. We employed a within-subjects cross-over design of 2 sequences and 2 periods. Usability was determined by attributes of efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction and quality of the results. We found that {SOCIO} saved time and reduced communication effort over Creately. {SOCIO} satisfied users to a greater extent than Creately, while in effectiveness results were similar. With respect to diagram quality, {SOCIO} outperformed Creately in terms of precision, while solutions with Creately had better recall and perceived success. However, in terms of accuracy and error scores, both tools were similar.},

Although many novel bots are being designed and deployed, the terms used to describe them and their properties are vast, diverse, and often inconsistent. Even the concept of what is or is not a bot is unclear. This hinders our ability to study, understand, design, and classify bots. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of software bots, which focuses on the observable properties and behaviours of software bots, as well as the environments where bots are deployed and designed. We see this taxonomy as a focal point for a discussion in our community so that together we can deeply consider how to evaluate and understand existing bots, as well as how we may design more innovative and productive bots.},

	abstract = {Software repositories contain a plethora of useful information that can be used to enhance software projects. Prior work has leveraged repository data to improve many aspects of the software development process, such as, help extract requirement decisions, identify potentially defective code and improve maintenance and evolution. However, in many cases, project stakeholders are not able to fully benefit from their software repositories due to the fact that they need special expertise to mine their repositories. Also, extracting and linking data from different types of repositories (e.g., source code control and bug repositories) requires dedicated effort and time, even if the stakeholder has the expertise to perform such a task. Therefore, in this paper, we use bots to automate and ease the process of extracting useful information from software repositories. Particularly, we lay out an approach of how bots, layered on top of software repositories, can be used to answer some of the most common software development/maintenance questions facing developers. We perform a preliminary study with 12 participants to validate the effectiveness of the bot. Our findings indicate that using bots achieves very promising results compared to not using the bot (baseline). Most of the participants (90.0\%) find the bot to be either useful or very useful. Also, they completed 90.8\% of the tasks correctly using the bot with a median time of 40 seconds per task. On the other hand, without the bot, the participants completed 25.2\% of the tasks with a median time of 240 seconds per task. Our work has the potential to transform the {MSR} field by significantly lowering the barrier to entry, making the extraction of useful information from software repositories as easy as chatting with a bot.},

	abstract = {Development of mechatronic systems requires collaboration among experts from different design domains. In this paper the authors identify a set of challenges related to the design of mechatronic systems. The challenges are mostly related to integration of design and analysis tools, and automation of current design practices. Addressing these challenges enables the adoption of a concurrent development approach in which the synergetic effects that characterize mechatronic systems are taken into account during design. The main argument is that in order to deal with software development problems for complex mechatronic systems, there is a need to look at system design practices beyond concurrency, i.e., there is a need to consider the complex interdependencies among subsystems and the designers that develop them. A review on current methods and tools is carried out to identify possible solutions proposed in previous works. The purpose is not to make an extensive review, but to show that integration, from different points of view, is a major issue and that increasing the level of abstraction in the description of systems can help to overcome the integration challenges. An increased level of abstraction also forms a basis for addressing other issues in mechatronic product development, which are presented in this work. With that in mind, concepts for an integration framework are proposed. The goal of the framework is to support a multi-disciplinary design team to (almost) automatically generate and verify control software. Based on high-level architectural descriptions, the software generation and veriﬁcation process can be supported by knowledge-based methods and tools. Other goals are to support communication among engineers, improve reliability of designs, increase reuse of design knowledge, and reduce development time and development costs.},

Progress quickened with the spread of low-latency networking, then accelerated dramatically a few years ago. In 2016, task-focused chatbots became a centerpiece of machine intelligence, promising interfaces that are more engaging than robotic answering systems and that can accommodate our increasingly phone-based information needs. Hundreds of thousands were built. Creating successful non-trivial chatbots proved more difficult than anticipated. Some developers now design for human-chatbot (humbot) teams, with people handling difficult queries. This paper describes the conversational agent space, difficulties in meeting user expectations, potential new design approaches, uses of human-bot hybrids, and implications for the ultimate goal of creating software with general intelligence.},

To understand how Slack impacts development team dynamics, we designed an exploratory study to investigate how developers use Slack and how they beneﬁt from it. We ﬁnd that developers use Slack for personal, teamwide and community-wide purposes. Our research also reveals that developers use and create diverse integrations (called bots) to support their work.

While the benefits of both gamification and {ESN} in e-learning contexts are mostly well-known, systematic integration of both has been not sufficiently addressed yet. The main benefit of the combination is the seamless integration of learning into business processes. Nevertheless, in context of corporate training like in any other learning context, the motivation of learners is a barrier that needs to be taken into account. Feedback is a well-known mechanism that supports learning by addressing psychological needs and motivation of the learner. To illustrate approaches for motivation of learners in social serious games, we introduce a knowledge quiz and demonstrate potential feedback mechanisms (especially dashboards). The description of these mechanisms leads to a framework which describes different dashboard types and elements as well as their potential impact on motivation.},

Lacking practice and experience, junior designers need process support in order to make rational architecture decisions. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative multiple-case study conducted to ﬁnd out if decision viewpoints from van Heesch et al. (2012, in press) can provide such a support. The case study was conducted with four teams of software engineering students working in industrial software projects. Two of the four teams were instructed to document their decisions using decision viewpoints; the other two teams were not instructed to do so. We observed the students for a period of seven weeks by conducting weekly focus groups and by analyzing their work artifacts and minutes. Our ﬁndings suggest that junior designers who use decision viewpoints are more systematic in exploring and evaluating solution options. However, the decision viewpoints did not help them in managing requirements and complexity.},

As part of a research collaboration with {ABB}, we developed a decision documentation tool that aims to ensure industrial applicability. This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate the add-in, we conducted a case study with architects from {ABB}. In this study, we assessed to what extent and why software architects intend to use our approach. We therefore investigated the perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and contextual factors threat inﬂuence the architect’s intention to use the tool. We found that the tool has a high relevance for software architects, that it increases the quality of decision documentation and that it improves productivity of architects in various ways. With respect to ease-of-use, the study identiﬁed the need for better guidelines. With respect to contextual factors, we found several factors that inﬂuence the intention to use the add-in in an industrial environment.},

The purposes of this research are to (1) examine where Software Bots currently are being deployed in Shared Services organizations and (2) understand the business case, drivers and challenges. We conducted a survey involving Shared Services leaders, functional leaders and {RPA} experts and discuss the best practices for analysing and optimizing the business benefits of implementing Software Bots. The majority of the companies surveyed have limited application of Software Bots in automating their business processes and are finding difficulties in quantifying tangible savings and identifying cost of implementation. Based on these results we identify functional processes which are candidates for automation using Software Bots and outline implementation steps to automate processes beyond business process optimization.},

The results of a study of 130 employees provided empirical support for our model. These findings help clarify how different sources of recognition can shape the effective behavioural involvement in the workplace; they also emphasize the role of meaningfulness as an important psychological mechanism that explains the recognition–behaviour relation. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {Agile software development principles enable companies to successfully and quickly deliver software by meeting their customers' expectations while focusing on high quality. Many companies working with pure software systems have adopted these principles, but implementing them in companies dealing with non-pure software products is challenging. We identified a set of goals and practices to support large-scale agile development in companies that develop software-intense mechatronic systems. We used an inductive approach based on empirical data collected during a longitudinal study with six companies in the Nordic region. The data collection took place over two years through focus group workshops, individual on-site interviews, and complementary surveys. The primary benefit of large-scale agile development is improved quality, enabled by practices that support regular or continuous integration between teams delivering software, hardware, and mechanics. In this regard, the most beneficial integration cycle for deliveries is every four weeks, while continuous integration on a daily basis would favor software teams, other disciplines does not seem to benefit from faster integration cycles. We identified 108 goals and development practices supporting agile principles among the companies, most of them concerned with integration, therefrom, 26 agile practices are unique to the mechatronics domain to support adopting agile beyond pure software development teams. 16 of these practices are considered as key enablers, confirmed by our control cases.},

	abstract = {Enterprises are forecasted to spend more on chatbots than on mobile app development by 2021. Up to today little is known on the roles chatbots play in facilitating feedback exchange. However, digitization and automation put pressure on companies to setup digital work environments that enable reskilling of employees. Therefore, a structured analysis of feedback-related chatbots for Slack was conducted. Our results propose six archetypes that reveal the roles of chatbots in facilitating feedback exchange on performance, culture and ideas. We show that chatbots do not only consist of conversational agents integrated into instant messenger but are tightly linked to complementary frontend systems such as mobile and web apps. Like the upper part of an iceberg, the conversational agent is above water and visible within the chat, whereas many user interactions of feedback-related chatbots are only possible outside of the instant messenger. Further, we extract six design principles for chatbots as digital feedback systems. We do this by analyzing chatbots and linking empirically observed design features to (meta-)requirements derived from explanatory theory on feedback, selfdetermination and persuasive systems. The results suggest that chatbots benefit the social environment of conversation agents and the richness of the graphical user interface of external applications.},

Method: A systematic mapping study has been conducted, searching the main scientific databases. The search retrieved 170 citations and 19 articles were retained as primary studies. Results: The works were categorized according to four criteria: usability techniques, usability characteristics, research methods and type of chatbots. Conclusions: Chatbot usability is a very incipient field of research, where the published studies are mainly surveys, usability tests, and rather informal experimental studies. Hence, it becomes necessary to perform more formal experiments to measure user experience, and exploit these results to provide usability-aware design guidelines.},

However, mechatronics design is a complex activity involving the different fields of mechanics, electronics and software, and the article suggests that new design models describing the total mechatronic product in the initial design phases are needed. Based on the model morphology, it is possible to discuss properties of such models.},

	doi = {10.1109/ASRU46091.2019.9003764},
	abstract = {Due to the lack of publicly available resources, conversation summarization has received far less attention than text summarization. As the purpose of conversations is to exchange information between at least two interlocutors, key information about a certain topic is often scattered and spanned across multiple utterances and turns from different speakers. This phenomenon is more pronounced during spoken conversations, where speech characteristics such as backchanneling and false-starts might interrupt the topical flow. Moreover, topic diffusion and (intra-utterance) topic drift are also more common in human-to-human conversations. Such linguistic characteristics of dialogue topics make sentence-level extractive summarization approaches used in spoken documents ill-suited for summarizing conversations. Pointer-generator networks have effectively demonstrated its strength at integrating extractive and abstractive capabilities through neural modeling in text summarization. To the best of our knowledge, to date no one has adopted it for summarizing conversations. In this work, we propose a topic-aware architecture to exploit the inherent hierarchical structure in conversations to further adapt the pointer-generator model. Our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and attains more robust performance.},

Specifically, the ‘always on’ feature that makes it hard for users to cope with the load of conversational content and get up to speed after logging off for a while. In this demo, we present Collabot – a chat assistant service that implicitly learns users interests and social ties within a chat group and provides a personalized digest of missed content. Collabot assists users in coping with chat information overload by helping them understand the main topics discussed, collaborators, links and resources. This demo has two main contributions. First, we present a novel personalized group chat summarization algorithm; second the demonstration depicts a working implementation applied on different chat groups from different domains within {IBM}.

With the advent and increasing popularity of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning ({CSCL}), chat conversations have also started to be used in a formal educational setting. However, the main problem when tutors tried to assess their students’ chat conversations is that this process is very difficult and time consuming. Therefore, several efforts have been undertaken during the last years to develop a tool that supports the analysis of collaborative chat conversations used in an educational context. In this paper, we propose a solution based on Natural Language Processing ({NLP}), Social Network Analysis ({SNA}) and Latent Semantic Analysis ({LSA}) that can be used for several tasks: assessment of utterances and participants, important topics visualization, summarization and semantic search. Furthermore, a summary with the key findings from the first validation round of using this approach is presented.},

	abstract = {The usage of chatbot for handling the conversations is gradually increasing. By using this technique, companies can provide a real-time and efficient channel to deliver the information to their users. Chatbot can response significant volume of frequent-asked and typical questions, which is bound to reduce the company human resource consumption. However, sometimes a chatbot cannot satisfy users with the provided answers, in such situation, chatbot should be transferred to an agent in order to handle the rest of the conversation. A concise summary of the user utterances helps the agent to handle the rest of the chat without raising annoying delay. Because the dialog between chatbots and user is fragmented and informal when compared to classic summarization dataset, high complexity models often have difficulty in achieving ideal results. In this paper, we present an extractive chat summarization system to provide a concise summary of the discussed topics in chat. We conclude three groups of critical and universally applicable features dedicated to summarization tasks and use the features to extract keywords for ranking sentences’ importance in the chat. We evaluate supervised and unsupervised methods for keyword extraction and generate the summary by combining selected sentences with specific rules. We compare our obtained results with two state-of-art, deep learning based methods over a new chatlog dataset. Experimental results reveal our method to be more effective and efficient than currently popular, high complexity methods.},

Because of the great amount of the information we are provided it and thanks to development of Internet Technologies, text summarization has become an important tool for interpreting text information. Text summarization methods can be classified into extractive and abstractive summarization. An extractive summarization method involves selecting sentences of high rank from the document based on word and sentence features and put them together to generate summary. The importance of the sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. An abstractive summarization is used to understanding the main concepts in a given document and then expresses those concepts in clear natural language. In this paper, gives comparative study of various text summarization techniques.},

	abstract = {Text summarization is the process of extracting the important information which gives us the overall idea of the entire document. It is a tedious task for human beings to generate an abstract manually since it requires a rigorous analysis of the document. In order to ease human efforts and to reduce time, automatic summarization techniques prove to be very useful. Text summarization has two techniques viz. Extractive summarization and abstractive summarization. Extractive technique[1] is the one in which we generate a summery by using the relevant sentences in the document as they are, whereas in abstractive summarization technique[2] we form the sentences on our own and then combine these sentences to form an abstract. In this paper, an overall idea about the extractive methods is presented and we focus on the abstractive summarization methods.},

As new functionality in products is realized to a large extent through integration of mechanics, electronics and software the need for knowledge integration between these disciplines becomes central. Thus, the innovation and product development process has to be able to cope with low and high degrees of innovativeness in the same organization, for the same portfolio. After a brief wrap-up of recent concepts of innovation processes, the authors describe the specific characteristics of mechatronics design. Using the “degree of innovativeness” a key tailoring criterion, the authors will show how the existing and proven concept of idea management and innovation processes proposed by Thom as well as the staged-gate process proposed by Cooper have to be expanded to support mechatronic systems design and development. In the end, using this approach the development of a new product, an electro-hydraulic compact axis, is briefly sketched within the context of the proposed process.},

The main idea behind our proposed approach aims to integrate various stages such as design, simulation and physical implementations in development of mechatronics product or system. Students are asked to ﬁrst follow the structural design methodology to do the conceptual and further detail design for an open-ended problem, then to do appropriate simulation to verify the feasibility of the design, and at last to integrate all components and subsystems into a complete physical product or system. The V-model-related courses and structures were explained in detail, and project implementation experiences were described and discussed with the help of example student projects.},

	abstract = {The present paper proposes a methodology for mechatronic design projects based on industrial engineering techniques. Today, in industrial production the reduction of research and development time is one of the most important goals for engineers. This reduction will allow products to enter the market more efficiently, thus increasing profits for organizations. The analysis made on the Product Life Cycle ({PLC}) reveals the two areas where time is critical: R\&D and project construction. The use of Design of Experiments ({DOE}), supported by Creativity Phase and Project Management techniques, are powerful tools to reduce time in the initial phase of the project. However, students, engineers, and scientists consistently avoid the use of industrial engineering and applied statistical techniques. Many textbooks and courses primarily focus on statistical analysis, thus forgetting planning, design, execution, analysis, and interpretation. The aim of this paper is to change today’s teaching focus in engineering techniques towards new teaching models where scientific concepts and theories are applied to real world problems. To support this intention, students from {ITESM} Campus Queretaro worked on the development of a robotic project using a new model to design projects rapidly and efficiently. In line with the vision and mission of {ITESM}, this paper reflects the development of new models and techniques for learning projects oriented towards a methodology for the construction of high performance mechatronics design for students of mechatronic engineering.},
